        <h2 class="underline-turquoise">Overview</h2>
        <p>
          For this project, we worked with the start-up Warp to design a home
          page based on their project brief. This was an amazing opportunity to
          learn about designing with a team and complete the iterative design
          process (sketches, low fidelity wireframe, and high fidelity
          prototypes). We also received feedback on  our wireframe from both
          students in our class and David, a Senior Product Designer at Warp, in
          order to improve our design.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 class="underline-turquoise">Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Warp is a customizable terminal with collaborative tools and AI
          integration. To summarize the project brief, Warp does not have a
          centralized home page for users to view information about their files,
          team, usage, account and learn more about Warp. Currently, a lot of
          this information is in the settings page, which makes it difficult to
          find. The home page that we designed will serve as an aggregator that
          ultimately allows for increased discovery and usage of Warp’s
          features.

        <h2 class="underline-turquoise">Sketches</h2>
        <p>
          I first created sketches to explore different layouts for the screen
          and module (components on the screen)!

        <h2>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p class="text-turquoise">First Iteration</p>
        <p>
          We noticed that many of us organized content using sidebars and a
          topbar. Therefore, we opted to create a left-sidebar (which we noticed
          was an industry standard compared to a right-sidebar) and added a
          welcoming header for a personal touch. We selected the most-commonly
          found modules from our sketches to include in the left sidebar. We
          also wanted the homepage to be customizable after noticing this trend
          amongst the sketches. Thus, we allow users to hide individual modules
          and the left sidebar if desired. Moreover, many of us had separate
          team and individual pages, so we discussed how a user could navigate
          between these, ultimately deciding upon a toggle. Finally, we found
          that visualizing the items (workflows, sessions and notebooks) as
          boxes, rather than in a list, made the interface feel less
          crowded/overwhelming.

        <p>
          We gathered feedback from our class during a studio critique and from
          our contact at Warp. Here is some of the most common feedback:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If a user is on multiple teams, then a UI may not be the best
              design choice. (David also clarified that while Warp currently
              only allows a user to be on one team, in the future, a user will
              be able to join multiple teams.)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              unclear how to get from the current view to the terminal and how
              to get from the terminal to this view
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              unclear where the black arrow on the top left of the screen goes
              back to.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              order of modules on the left navigation bar should be based on
              what is most important to the user
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Having too many items in recents may defeat the point of an
              aggregator. In addition, people typically do not interact with a
              side scroll, so it may be unnecessary.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Rather than displaying all the items, folders and sessions on the
              home, you can only show a few and then have a “view more” button
              that opens another page.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              People may want to have more control over how they see the items
              in their drive. For instance, you could have an option to toggle
              between list and gallery mode, filters and sorting.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-turquoise">Second Iteration</p>
        <p>
          We felt that having four screens was too few to show user interaction
          with the various components, so we created more screens in our second
          iteration. We removed the metrics from the left sidebar since metrics
          was last on our priorities list, and it did not feel necessary for
          users to constantly see this information (better in the account page).
          Moreover, we received a lot of feedback about making the drive more
          customizable and realized that we were missing basic features, like
          trash and a search bar. Therefore, in addition to including these
          features, we added sorting, filters, and two modes for viewing. We
          also decided not to extend the recent items beyond the page because
          having both horizontal and vertical scrolling, especially when the
          user has many items in their drive, could be confusing. Additionally,
          we changed the toggle (navigating between “Personal” and “Team”) to a
          drop-down since David clarified that in the future Warp would allow
          users to be on multiple teams. Finally, we wanted to make it easy to
          navigate between the home page and terminal. We opted to use the same
          top bar as the Warp app, but added a new tab for the home page,
          replacing the drive tab since the drive is integrated into the home.

            With this project, we learned a lot about designing as a team and
            interacting with real clients in order to achieve a design goal.
            Overall, communication was a huge part of this process– both
            communication within our team and with the startup founders. From
            the very beginning, we prioritized understanding the needs and
            expectations of our client, and this involved active listening
            during meetings, thoughtful questions, and thorough documentation of
            their feedback and concerns.
