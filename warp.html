        <h2 class="underline-turquoise">Overview</h2>
        <p>
          I worked with a team to design a home page for the start-up
          <a href="https://www.warp.dev/" class="underline-link">Warp</a>
          based on their project brief.
          <b
            >Warp is a customizable terminal with collaborative tools and AI
            integration.</b
          >
          This was an amazing opportunity to learn about designing with a team
          and complete the iterative design process (sketches, low fidelity
          wireframe, and high fidelity prototypes). We also received feedback on
          our wireframe from both students in our class and David, a Senior
          Product Designer at Warp, in order to improve our design.

        <h2 class="underline-turquoise">Problem</h2>
        <p>
          To summarize the project brief,
          <b>Warp does not have a centralized home page</b> for users to view
          information about their files, team, usage, account and learn more
          about Warp. Currently, a lot of this information is in the settings
          page, which makes it difficult to find. The home page that we design
          will serve as an aggregator that ultimately allows for
          <b>increased discovery and usage of Warp’s features</b>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 class="underline-turquoise">Sketches</h2>
        <p>
          Each group member created sketches to explore various layouts for the
          modules and what they would look like in different user states. I
          focused on designing for both new users (requiring more instructional
          guidance) and active users (with their current content readily
          accessible).
        </p>
        <div id="sketches" class="hor">
          <img alt="Sketch layout one" src="./assets/warp/sketch1.png" />
          <img alt="Sketch layout two" src="./assets/warp/sketch2.png" />
          <img alt="Sketch layout three" src="./assets/warp/sketch3.png" />
          <img alt="Sketch layout four" src="./assets/warp/sketch4.png" />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p class="text-turquoise">First Iteration</p>
        <p>
          Our main goal with the home page was to create a
          <b>user-friendly, glanceable interface</b> that allows users to
          understand their current state and easily access their content. We
          achieved this through a <b>split layout</b>: the left sidebar displays
          metrics, live sessions, activities, and resources, while the main
          section shows folders, files, and sessions. Additionally, since Warp
          is designed for collaboration, it was important for users to
          <b>seamlessly switch between personal and team views</b>, which
          organizes their content while still keeping team information
          accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drawing inspiration from Figma Home, Google Drive and GitHub home, we
          opted to
          <b>merge the current drive on Warp into our new home page</b>. This
          approach enhances how intuitive the app is to use and reduces time
          spent searching for desired content.

        </div>
        <p class="text-turquoise">Feedback</p>
        <p>
          To improve our design, we gathered feedback from our class and our
          contact at Warp. Here is some of the feedback:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If user is on multiple teams, toggle may not be best design choice
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Unclear how to get from current view to terminal (and vice versa)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Unclear where black arrow on top left of screen goes</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>People typically do not interact with a horizontal scroll</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              People may want more control over how they see items in drive (EX:
              list vs gallery mode, filters and sorting)
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-turquoise">Second Iteration</p>
        <p>
          Using the feedback that we recieved, we revised our low fidelity
          wireframes. We <b>removed the metrics module</b> from the left sidebar
          since it did not feel necessary for users to constantly see this
          information. Moreover, we
          <b>added sorting, filters, two modes for viewing, trash and search</b>
          to the drive. We also <b>removed the horizontal scroll</b> for viewing
          recent items. Additionally, we
          <b>changed the toggle between personal and team to a drop-down</b>
          since David clarified that in the future Warp would allow users to be
          on multiple teams. Finally, we wanted to make it easy to navigate
          between the home page and terminal. We opted to use the
          <b>same top bar as the Warp app</b>, but added a new tab for the home
          page.

        <h2 class="underline-turquoise">Style Guide</h2>
        <p>
          Developers are often online for long periods of time, so having a
          website that is <b>minimalistic, professional, and easy to read</b> is
          important. When creating our style guide, we kept in mind these goals.
          We adapted the style guide provided by Warp, selecting required font
          sizes, icons and colors.
        </p>
        <div id="style-guide" class="hor">

          Combining the low fidelity wireframe with the style guide brought our
          design to life in the
          <a
            class="underline-link"

            target="”_blank”"
            >interactive high fidelity prototype</a
          >!
        </p>
        <p>
          We emphasized key design principles in our final prototype to fulfill
          our users' needs. First, our design aligns users'
          <b>mental model</b> of a home page by providing access to all app
          features directly from the home page. Secondly, we used
          <b>hierarchical design</b> and the <b>F scan pattern</b> to create a
          layout that allows users to quickly find what they want. There is the
          welcome and navigational information across the top, key information
          on the left sidebar and access to files in the center. Regarding
          hierarchy, each section has a larger heading and smaller body text so
          users can easily find the main sections.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our project focuses on depicting the design of the home page based on
          the user state and the various actions that they can take. Here is an
          active user navigating through their personal home page to one of
          their team home pages:

            With this project, I learned a lot about designing as a team and
            interacting with real clients in order to achieve a design goal.
            Overall, <b>communication was a huge part of this process</b> – both
            communication within my team and with the startup contact. From the
            very beginning, we
            <b
