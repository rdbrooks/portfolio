        <h2 class="underline-orange">Overview</h2>
        <p>
          I worked with a team to code a website to organize collaboration hours
          (collab hours) for my software engineering course, and we presented a
          demo of the final product to course staff. This project involved
          creating a specification guide, conducting user research,
          brainstorming features and implementing our solution. Specifically, I
          oversaw user interviews, ethics evaluation, frontend and backend
          integration and the implementation of a Firebase login system.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2 class="underline-orange">Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Every student in the software engineering course serves as a collab
        partner once per week and helps other students debug their code.
        However, collab hours are a little bit hectic, with the TAs trying to
        call out names to pair students, while also trying to help students with
        escalated issues. Also, we realized that there is large variety in how
        collab hours are run and the partnering process. Some TAs assign a
        debugging partner and others ask for volunteers to help. Finally, there
        are many resources used in collaboration hours, but they are scattered
        across various locations.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project can ease this experience for students and TAs and make
        collab hours more productive, organized and standardize it.

        <p>
          To start, I conducted user research to understand the needs of
          students and staff, which then shaped our project. Here are some of
          the questions that I asked and my findings:

        <p class="text-orange">Conclusions</p>
        <p>
          All of the users that we interviewed found value in the creation of an
          application to facilitate and organize collab hours. However, we did
          learn that the format of collab hours will likely be changing next
          semester. Therefore, our code should be really well-documented and use
          generic types as well as the strategy pattern where possible so it is
          easy to modify in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using an algorithm to match partners, this will ensure that people
          get equal opportunities to be debugging partners, which was a common
          concern users had about how collab section currently works. Since
          currently a TA does the matching, automating this will allow more
          availability for escalation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another idea brought up numerous times during the stakeholder research
          is a timer of how long students have been partnered. This lets
          students know when they are able to escalate, and escalation will only
          occur once the debugging form has been filled out and the necessary
          time has elapsed. Many TAs expressed how many moving parts there are
          to collab section, such as taking attendance, making pairings and
          escalation, so having one system responsible for all of this will make
          it easier for TAs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, attendance will be taken based on when the student logs
          into the app, which will automate the process and allow TAs to see who
          has logged in. The history will be automatically downloaded to a CSV
          after a TA ends a session and this same CSV will be populated
          everytime.
